# IBM Security Verify SaaS with Access integration scenario


[Lab environment for Verify SaaS and Verify Access on Containers](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/verify-poc/resources)


As part of sales engagements, it is common for clients to ask IBM to prove that our proposed solution can be used to implement the use cases that they need to meet their business requirements. [This pre-prepared environment](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/verify-poc/environments), along with an IBM Security Verify SaaS (Verify SaaS) tenant, can be used to build out a wide variety of use cases covering both workforce and consumer identity and access management. The Verify SaaS POC guide, linked from the resources section, provides the high-level steps, and pointers to additional assets, to help guide you in configuring some common use case scenarios.

The Centos Virtual Machine in the environment has container and Kubernetes services installed which can be used to exlore Verify Access container deployment. A step-by-step guide for deployment in a Kubernetes cluster is included in the resources section.
